Casual Bananas was an online gaming community and modded server platform active from 2011 to 2015. During its prime, it stood out for offering highly customized game experiences co-designed with its players—long before “live service” became the norm. We were among the first to incorporate persistent digital avatars, token-based economies, and a strong social layer that brought players together beyond the game itself.

This GitHub organization serves as an archive of the tools, mods, and infrastructure that powered that unique ecosystem. It’s a tribute to what was built—and to the community that made it special.

## 🧰 Archive

Here you’ll find a mix of server scripts, modding tools, community utilities, and documentation for old systems we built. Not everything aged gracefully, but much of it reflects a period of intense innovation and experimentation.

We’re restoring and uploading what we can, prioritizing projects that had significant impact or were requested by former community members.

## 🔒 Security Projects

Casual Bananas was also involved in developing various security-related tools, including cheat detection systems and, at times, reverse-engineered game clients. Due to past licensing agreements and the uncertain legal status of some of that work today, those parts of our portfolio will not be made public. We appreciate your understanding.

## 📬 Reconnecting with the Community

This organization was created by popular request. Over the years, many of you reached out asking about old files, codebases, or simply where everyone went. If you're looking to reconnect, we’re maintaining a registry of former members and collaborators. Drop us a message at [email address] and we’ll help coordinate where possible.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use or fork these projects?**
Yes, most codebases here are provided under open licenses. Check each repository for specific terms.

**Q: What happened to the anti-cheat and security tools?**
These remain private due to their historical licensing and unclear current usage. Publishing them could lead to unnecessary legal complications.

**Q: How can I get in touch with former players or staff?**
Send us a message. We're keeping a lightweight registry to help reconnect old friends and collaborators.

**Q: Are there any plans for a revival?**
Not formally, but we’ve learned to never say never. This is an archive, not a roadmap—but if something interesting grows out of it, we won’t stand in the way.

Thanks to everyone who was part of the original Casual Bananas community. This archive exists because you asked for it—and because what we built together still matters, even years later.
